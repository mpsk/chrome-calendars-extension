# Privacy Policy for Multi-Account Calendar

**Last updated:** December 7, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **Multi-Account Calendar** ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our own servers or any third-party servers.

However, the extension processes the following data directly on your device and via Google's official APIs to function:

*   **Authentication Data:** We use `chrome.identity` to authenticate with your Google Accounts.
*   **Calendar Data:** We fetch your calendar lists and events from the Google Calendar API.
*   **User Profile:** We fetch your basic profile information (email, name, photo) to display in the extension's interface.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

All data is used solely for the purpose of displaying your calendar events within the extension.

*   **Local Storage:** Your authentication tokens and cached calendar events are stored locally on your device using `chrome.storage.local`. This data never leaves your browser.
*   **Direct Communication:** The extension communicates directly between your browser and Google's servers (Google Calendar API). No intermediate servers are used.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do **not** share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties. Your data remains strictly between your browser and Google.

## 4. Third-Party Services

This extension relies on Google APIs. By using this extension, you are also subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
